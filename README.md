# Sales and Profit Analysis and Visualization of AtliQ Hardware

In this project, i used the database of AtliQ Hardware. It is a company which supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients across India. The company has a head office in Dehli and regional offices throughout India.

I tried to create a real world scenario in which the company's total revenue is declining every year. I used the database provided in the internet. I used MySQL for database and Tableau for visualization.

## The Steps Involved:
1. Importing data into MySQL database:
-First, i collected the required database from the internet and imported those data in MySQL. Applied different SQL queries to view different sales information with respect to locations, year, customer, cities, etc.

2. Data Cleaning & ETL in Tableau:
-I then connected the MySQL database to tableau and performed cleaning of data to eradicate various impurities.


3. Designing Individual Tableau Sheets:
